# Pokemon Rating App <br>

üëã Hey everyone! Welcome to the Web Development Bootcamp.
<br>
Over the few weeks, we'll be using what we learned from previous lessons on using HTML and CSS and now incorporating Javascript to create a pokemon rating app.


# Learning Goals

- HTML structure
- CSS Styling
- Build our database
- Install npm json-server dependency
- Access information from an API using a GET request
- Update the DOM
- Listen for user events and update the DOM in response

### ‚öíÔ∏è Tech Stack: HTML, CSS and Javascript

<br>

# How to get started

Use the starter code folder to grab the basic HTML, CSS template and get started with building the tasks from Session 01 Readme file.
<br>
As a reference, you can take a look at the code after the end of each session.

# User Stories:
- install npm json server
- create images folder with at least five pokemon cards
- within the db.json file add the keys value pairs
- e.g, id, name, hp, image, rating, comments
- refer to session 01 to continue...
